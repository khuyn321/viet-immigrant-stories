          After nearly 20 years of fighting, the Vietnam war came to a bitter end in 1975 when communist North Vietnam
          succeeded in capturing Saigon, the capital city and last beacon of South Vietnam. Millions of Southern
          Vietnamese people were consequently left feeling abandonded, fearful of the new communist regime, despair at
          the loss of their country, over the losses of their homes, and uncertainty about the future.
          Over the next few years, millons of Vietnamese would flee the country by boat or through refugee programs,
          causing the biggest Vietnamese diaspora in history into the United States.

        <p>
          These stories are some of many personal accounts from the book <em>"Voices of Vietnamese Boat People"</em> by
          Mary Terrel Cargill and Jade Quang Huynh that showcase the journey-- the harsh conditions in small boats, the
          refugee camps, the difficulty adjusting to a new way of life in a new country-- that many Vietnamese people
          experienced in the hope for a better future after the fall of their country.

          This is dedicated to my mom, who has allowed me to share her story here as one of the accounts. Thank you to
          my family for allowing me to tell your story and understand deeper, just how much you had to go through for me
          to be able to live and thrive in the United States.
