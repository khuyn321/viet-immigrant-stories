        <p>After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, Ai-Van Do, the daughter of Minh Tan Do, described how “It was as if a
          black curtain has fallen on our country. All of former South Vietnam fell into despair” (pg. 8). Her
          family left Saigon for her father’s hometown, feeling both joy and sorrow about the uncertain future. They
          “worried about new life, not knowing how communists would act” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>Soon after, Communist authorities sent her father to a reeducation camp where he was forced to do hard
          labor. In the hospital where her mother worked, new “doctors” from the North replaced the former ones, and
          her mother—sick and paralyzed—went untreated (MISSING PAGE). The family built a small hut among coconut
          trees. Although the Communists had not yet seized their property, they were encouraged to increase
          production “for the country’s prosperity” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>“Under the 'New Regime,' everyone had to work hard. The slogan of the day was 'Labor is the glory'”
          (MISSING PAGE). Ai-Van's parents, who had served under the former government, were especially pressured to
          prove they had been “awakened.” With no experience, they were forced into farming and fishing labor. As
          collectivism intensified, “Soon the new government became more severe and used collectivism for every type
          of production. The people did not own their fields, their boats, or any type of things they used to earn a
          living” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>Despite some opportunities for trade, “this two-way commerce provided the people too little for
          productive life” (MISSING PAGE). Former businessmen, civil servants, and soldiers—like Ai-Van’s
          family—were pushed out of the cities into new economic zones. Their homes were confiscated, and they were
          made to farm under difficult conditions. The government stripped people of their freedoms. “They forced
          such people to perform hard labor in the harsh mountain regions for several months a year. Because of
          rough treatment, the people felt as though the communists were punishing them and burning revenge. Many
          people died from work related accidents or malaria” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>Disillusionment grew. “The people understood that their hopes for peace and joy would not be realized”
          and began to long for a return of the former government. Christian gatherings especially raised suspicion,
          and anyone seen as discontent risked being “brainwashed or forced to do strenuous labor in the following
          mountain region sometimes never to be heard from again” (pg. 10). During these dark times, the family
          looked to secret broadcasts for hope and learned of refugees escaping by boat.</p>
        <p>In March 1976, they learned of a group that had escaped by fishing boat. Inspired, Ai-Van’s father began
          to plan their escape. He picked up basic navigation skills and formed a small group of five who hoped to
          reach the Philippines, known for welcoming refugees. They pooled their money, jewelry, and supplies. For
          three months, they secretly stored 600 liters of fuel near the shore. But disaster struck when they
          learned the fuel had been stolen and sold by a group member whose wife had just given birth.</p>
        <p>Despite the setback, Ai-Van’s parents didn’t give up. Publicly, they acted loyal to the regime—“a good
          system”—but secretly resumed escape plans. They registered as fishermen, waiting on permits while
          continuing to hide fuel beneath their home. Neighbors began spying on them. Around the same time, they
          learned of another group urgently planning their own escape after a recent boat had fled. Both groups
          joined forces, holding secret Sunday meetings to plan.</p>
        <p>Ai-Van later reflected, “My parents lived like fish in a fish bowl. They could not adapt to their present
          circumstances and their future looked dark and uncertain. We were all emaciated and sick, especially my
          mother and I. My parents wanted to leave this prison of the country as soon as possible” (pg. 14).</p>
        <p>One night, the group leader knocked on their door to say they had been discovered and had to leave that
          night. Though their boat was small, old, and under-supplied, the family had no choice. Ai-Van’s mother
          told her father, “It's up to you. Our daughter and I will follow you anywhere, although we may die” (pg.
          15). As they snuck out, Ai-Van recalled, “My daughter, keep silent! If you cry, the Communists will catch
          us!” She obeyed. She was three years old (pg. 15).</p>
        <p>In their tiny fishing boat, they sailed into open water with only a small compass, a simple world map,
          and three flashlights. “The man steered the boat while my father tended the engine. We were braving the
          waters in a fishing boat that was probably the smallest ever to sail over the sea” (pg. 15). Over eight
          dangerous days, they traveled more than 800 miles.</p>
        <p>On June 14, 1978, the first day at sea, her father wrote: “Our first lunch on the sea consisted of sugar
          and rice paper that we softened by dipping into water. Ai-Van tried sweet potatoes with a little milk but
          she vomited. We are all afraid for her health” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>On June 17th, during a storm: “...the rain poured upon us mercilessly. At 11:00 a.m. one spring of the
          engine broke and we could no longer run it. This meant having to put up the sail. Ai-Hang embraced our
          little daughter and wept in fright” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>On June 18th: “…Four unrecognizable bodies floated past us; they were probably other Vietnamese boat
          people. It was frightening to think that the seemingly infinite sea could at any time so easily swallow
          our tiny boat. All of us still think that perhaps we will die here” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>Finally, on June 21st, “Soon Thoi spotted a lighted region in the east. When Ai-Hang and I awoke, we were
          certain that today would be the last day of our voyage because we could clearly see many mountains and
          several lands” (MISSING PAGE). They arrived at the Manila Harbor, exhausted but alive. “We struggled out
          of the boat and took our first walk on land after eight days during which we had struggled with death.
          Some policemen received us and took us to the Marivelles Police Station in Batan” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
        <p>The family lived in a refugee camp in Bataan for a year in harsh conditions, surviving on minimal rations
          in a shack made of scrap wood. Eventually, they were sponsored by Oakhurst Baptist Church in Clarksdale,
          Mississippi, and relocated to the United States.</p>

        <p>Ai-Van later returned to Vietnam with her father in 1993 and again with her whole family in 1995. “Vietnam is
          a beautiful country. I love the land, the people, and all of the mountains. Although on the surface, Vietnam
          seems like an improving third world country, it is still communist dominated and thirsty for freedom. My dream
          is to one day return to a free Vietnam, to see the smiles of a free people” (MISSING PAGE).</p>
