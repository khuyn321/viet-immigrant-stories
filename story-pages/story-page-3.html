        <p>Binh Le, the son of a former South Vietnamese soldier, recounted the struggles his family faced under the
          communist regime following the Vietnam War. Due to his father's affiliation with the former government, the
          family was mistreated. <em>"In 1975, my father was put in a re-education camp for six years, but even when he
            got
            out, the police kept watching him. That was one reason my parents wanted to escape." (pg. 91).</em> This
          constant
          surveillance and the lack of future
          opportunities for the children pushed his parents to consider escape: <em>“In Vietnam,
            we had no chance of getting a good education, certainly no chance for higher education” (pg.91).</em></p>
        <p>Tragedy struck later that year when Binh's two older brothers disappeared at sea during another escape
          attempt. <em>"We never saw them again. Even now my mom cries every time we mention them... Also, a few months
            after my older brothers disappeared, my parents lost their newborn son" (pg. 92).</em> After their release
          from
          prison, the government confiscated their home, forcing the family to live on the streets before constructing a
          makeshift hut from trees. Despite the risks, they remained determined: <em>"Although getting caught and
            imprisoned
            frightened us, we weren't too frightened to try again. Like a lot of other people, we would rather have died
            than stay in Vietnam. The conditions were that bad" (pg. 92).</em></p>
        <p>n 1984, after over a year of preparation and blending in with local fishermen, they made their third and
          successful escape. <em>"108 people escaped on that boat, including my father, my two sisters, one of my
            brothers,
            and myself. My mother stayed home with three remaining brothers." (pg. 93).</em> On June 16, 1984, they left
          for
          Malaysia across the South China Sea. <em>"We were on
            the sea for six terrible days... Only my dad and a few men were well enough to be awake... Most of the
            children and women were lying about as if they were dead" (pg. 93).</em> Facing storms and the loss of their
          navigator, they finally reached Pulau Bidong, where they encountered squalid refugee camp conditions,
          including giant rats and rotten food. <em>"Once I was so sick, I almost died. My dad took me to a little
            clinic
            near the headquarters for help" (pg. 93).</em></p>
        <p>Despite the harshness, Binh found gratitude in the opportunity to attend school for the first time and
          receive his first communion. <em>"Even though the conditions on the island were hard, living there was still a
            lot
            of fun... We felt free. It was a whole different world from Vietnam" (pg. 94).</em></p>
        <p>Eventually, Catholic charities agreed to sponsor their relocation to the United States. Before arriving,
          Binh's family was transferred to a camp in Bataan, Philippines, where they stayed for six months. <em>"I cried
            every time I read mom's letter to me. I missed her so much. We got letters from her only three or four times
            while we were at Pulau Bidong,
            but those letters were very important. Things weren't going well back in Vietnam, but she didn't talk about
            those things because she didn't want to worry us." (pg. 95).</em>
          Life in Bataan offered more freedom, formal education with Filipino and American teachers, and exposure to
          cultural training for American life.</p>
        <p>Once approved for relocation, the family traveled from Manila to Seattle, then to Memphis. <em>"The first two
            weeks in Memphis, I was too terrified to leave the house, but eventually I got out into my new world" (pg.
            97).</em></p>

        <p>Years later, Binh's prayers to reunite with his mother were answered. <em>"I would say, 'God, let me see my
            mom
            again. I will listen to her and not talk back to her and be a good child.' I promised everything" (pg. 98).
            In
            1989, a boat owner in Vietnam offered to bring his mother and brother to Malaysia, if they paid $3,000.
            After
            confirming with a letter from Pulau Bidong, the family sent the money. "My mom was on the last boat they
            accepted at Pulau Bidong. She stayed there two years" (pg. 98).</em></p>
        <p>Finally, in 1991, she arrived in Memphis. <em>"When she arrived in Memphis, she started crying because she
            was so
            happy to see us. I stayed around her for days. I couldn't leave her. I hadn't seen her for seven long years,
            from 1984 until 1991" (pg. 98). </em></p>
        <p>Today, Binh maintains contact with his two brothers who remained in Vietnam due to financial limitations and
          now have families of their own. He hopes to reunite with them someday: <em> "I haven't seen them for 13 years"
            (pg. 98).</em></p>
