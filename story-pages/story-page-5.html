        <p>During the fall of Saigon in 1975, as U.S. helicopters pulled out of the country, my mom's family was
          presented with a rare opportunity. A relative—my mom’s half-sister on her father's side—was working at the
          U.S. Embassy and asked if there was anyone in the family she should take with her, given that the U.S. was
          retreating.</p>
        <p><em>“My half-sister said, ‘You know, our country is falling to the communists. Americans are taking everybody
            back, and they said if I want to go, I can go. Do you want any one of your kids to go with me? And at the
            time my dad came back and told my mom, ‘How about we send our oldest because he's coming up on that age
            where you have to register for the military.’ He was 16 or 17. In a year or so the communists would draft
            him, so…“</em></p>
        <p>After discussing it, my mom’s parents decided it would be best to send their oldest son, who was nearing the
          age for mandatory military registration. They feared he would soon be drafted by the communists. He left
          Vietnam with my mom's half-sister and settled in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he worked at her buffet-style Chinese
          restaurant and eventually learned English.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the rest of the family remained in Vietnam. Her brother worked hard and saved money to eventually
          sponsor their immigration over the next few years.</p>
        <p>At the time, my mom was unaware of any escape plans. She was only 11 years old and deeply attached to her
          grandmother, whom they would be leaving behind. Fearing my mom’s reaction, her family decided not to tell
          her—and instead drugged her to keep her calm during the escape.</p>
        <p>Following the recent death of her grandfather, the family used his funeral as a cover to leave Saigon without
          arousing communist suspicion. The communists were vigilant about possible escape attempts, and anyone caught
          could be jailed or sent to a reeducation camp.</p>
        <p><em>“Let's say 8 or 9pm they gave me medicine so I wouldn't be running around. I remember the adults talking,
            I was like ‘What is going on? Why is everyone here? And why am I at my uncle's house near the ocean?’”</em>
        </p>
        <p>My mom's family had paid the escape organizer with around 30 gold bars to secure passage for her and her
          siblings—four sons and two daughters. My grandfather was ill at the time, so they made the difficult decision
          to leave him behind, believing he would not survive the journey.</p>
        <p><em>“So when they woke me up at 2 or 3 in the morning and go, I was in and out. Groggy. Had to be hush hush,
            not
            make any sound. Then I remembered my feet touched the sand and someone picked me up and threw me in the
            boat.
            And as the boat was going out, there was some screaming and pointing [coming from the shore].”</em></p>
        <p><em>“She was screaming, ‘Oh my god what's going on?!’ She thought it was ghosts or someone trying to rob her.
            The
            captain had to hush her off, saying ‘No no, shh, here's some money! Don't say anything! Go away please!’ By
            the time it took the 32 of us to get on the boat, it was like 4:30AM!”</em></p>
        <p>As they fled, early-morning fishermen spotted the commotion and ran to alert the authorities. Fortunately, my
          mom’s family and the others managed to launch the boat before they were caught.</p>
        <p>The escape boat was small and shabby, barely fitting the 33 passengers aboard.</p>
        <p><em>“The boat was a tiny, shabby boat. It fit 33 people and if you put your knees up to your chest, that's
            how we
            sat for 2 days. The salt water was splashing on us– we had no cover. It was maybe the size of 2 cars, and we
            sat so tightly. We peed and pooped where we were. We don't eat, we don't drink.”</em></p>
        <p>Their plan was to reach international waters and hope to be rescued by passing ships. Many "boat people"
          risked this dangerous journey—some were rescued, others fell victim to pirates or drowned.</p>
        <p>After two or three harrowing days at sea, their group was lucky enough to be picked up by a Greek cargo ship
          transporting thousands of new cars. The rescue itself was a daunting task.</p>
        <p><em>“You look up to this gigantic, 20-story high ship. And even if it approaches you, the waves alone keep
            pushing you out… It was wow, an ordeal.”</em></p>
        <p>The crew of 10 or so men dropped down a rickety ladder that kept flailing and looked weak. The leader
          exclaimed, “Okay guys
          this is it!! We have to hang on for dear life!” and then, one by one, they began climbing the rickety ladder.
          The adults climbed first, carrying the children on their backs. My mom remembered clinging tightly to a man as
          he climbed the treacherous ladder up the enormous ship. Later, she found out that they had dropped down a
          sturdier metal ladder, and that first ladder had been a
          "test" to ensure they were
          genuine, desperate refugees and not pirates. Her sister and other siblings were lucky to climb up using the
          second one.
        </p>
        <p>Once they were actually on the ship, they were surprised and relieved at how good the conditions were after
          what they had undergone.
        </p>
        <p><em>“People shower and they give us clothes… And then they prepared food for you. You get to sit down and
            bite into an apple– and I didn't even know what an apple was. And they made us eggs in the morning. I was
            just going ‘Wow.’”</em></p>
        <p>They stayed on the ship, named The Aquamarine, for five days while arrangements were made. Ultimately, they
          were transported to the Hawkins Road Refugee Camp in Singapore—a smaller camp where processing times were
          shorter than in other places.</p>

        </div>
        <p>At Hawkins Road Camp, life was relatively good compared to other refugee camps.</p>
        <p>My mom described a happy, lively atmosphere: small shops set up by other Vietnamese refugees, daily meals, a
          modest allowance, and opportunities to leave the camp occasionally to visit town. She made friends, including
          a young boy, while her siblings tried to earn extra money.</p>
        <p>Thanks to her oldest brother, who had already settled in the U.S., they had a sponsor—a crucial factor in
          their quicker processing time.</p>
        <p><em>“If you don't have any siblings or family in any country, then it's up to them to decide where you should
            go. And at that point a lot of the folks are happy to go anywhere... Canada, Australia, England… had we not
            had anyone here, we might have ended up anywhere.”</em></p>
        <p>After four months at the refugee camp, my mom’s family reunited with her oldest brother in Tulsa, Oklahoma,
          who had been there for five years. They stayed in Tulsa for less than a year before hearing about larger
          Vietnamese communities in California.</p>

        <p>The family relocated to Orange, California, where her oldest brother rented a small house. Though crowded, it
          became the home where my mom grew up, attending middle school and El Modena High School.</p>
        <p>Although the Vietnamese population at her high school was larger than it had been in Oklahoma, my mom still
          experienced racism. Government assistance helped the family settle in, and they often picked up discarded
          furniture from the streets, sometimes to her brother’s dismay.</p>
        <p>Later, my mom enrolled in a cosmetology program through her high school, riding the bus every day until she
          passed her final exam and became a licensed cosmetologist.</p>
        <p>Life has since improved significantly for my mom, and she remains deeply grateful for the opportunities she
          has had.</p>
        <p>Years later, she returned to Vietnam with her partner to visit her childhood village and reconnect with
          relatives. The landscape remained beautiful, but the heavy presence of communist symbolism was still starkly
          visible.</p>
