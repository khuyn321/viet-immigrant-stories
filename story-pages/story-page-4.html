        <p>Nhan T. Le, the youngest of nine siblings, grew up in a comfortable, middle-class family in Southern Vietnam.
          Though she was just a teenager during the North’s invasion of the South, she focused on her studies,
          eventually graduating from college and working at a hospital. She noted that despite the government’s changes,
          life was simple. However, after the communist takeover, her family moved to Go Cong City to
          farm, while she worked at Cho Ray Hospital. As conditions worsened under the new regime, many of her friends
          fled the country, and she too began seeking a way to escape.</p>
        <p>Her first escape attempt (organized by her brother-in-law) failed when police surrounded their escape boat,
          causing a scattering panic of the 100+ people that were on it.
          She found temporary refuge running away in a stranger’s home, where a kind woman warned her and 2 others:
          <em>“You can't stay here,
            children,” she said. “My son is a V.C. and the head of this village. He will be home soon. You can't hide
            anywhere on this island because they [the V.C.] will capture you anyway in the morning, since the island is
            isolated” (pg. 133)</em>
          . After narrowly avoiding capture and hiding in a cemetery, Nhan reflected in fear
          and
          sadness: <em>“Where would I go if I didn’t stay here, I asked myself... I wanted to go home. I wanted to see
            my
            parents. I didn’t want to escape anymore. I kept repeating these thoughts in my head and then fell asleep.”
            (pg. 135).</em>
        </p>
        <p>The kind woman returned the next day with her 19-year-old nephew to help her escape, and Nhan pretended to be
          his girlfriend as they
          passed through checkpoints. On her way home, she coincidentally met the captain of the failed escape, a man
          named Nho. They struck up a conversation on a bus, and though she didn’t catch his name then, he would soon
          return to her life. After reconnecting, Nho began visiting her. Her family disapproved of the relationship,
          but she didn’t care. In September 1985, she married him.</p>
        <p>Two months later, they attempted another escape. They planned to depart from Vam Lang, traveling with about
          80 people hidden below deck. As they tried to coast by, the police noticed and attacked: <em>“Stay where you
            are. We’ll shoot if you
            move,” a policeman shouted from the shore as others aimed their guns at our boat. “Get on the deck and put
            your hands up” (pg. 138).</em> Captured and
          taken to a nearby elementary school, Nhan and her husband were separated and sent to labor camps. She later
          recalled a related tragedy, <em>“My in-law, Xang and his wife had tried to escape with us this time, and later
            Xang died in the
            camp. He didn’t even know that his wife was pregnant” (pg. 138).</em></p>
        <p>Life in the labor camp was harsh. Prisoners defecated and urinated in open sewage systems they had to build
          themselves, got sick often, and received minimal
          meals. <em>“I hated the part where the guard lectured us about how wonderful it was to labor and how wonderful
            Ho
            Chi Minh and the Communist Party were. When he ended his lecture, we always had to write our confession”
            (pg. 139).</em> With help from
          her
          sister, who bribed the guards, Nhan was released after eight months. Her husband was forced to stay longer in
          his camp, so she visited him monthly until he
          was finally released 3 years after her in July 1987.</p>
        <p>In September 1987, they tried again, sailing to Pulau Bidong with 73 others: <em>“I spent three nights and 4
            days
            with 73 people on a rickety boat sailing directly to Pulau Bidong. We landed at this refugee camp and joined
            20,000 refugees already there. We got our immunization shots and received Food Supplies once a week:
            salt, fish sauce, and canned sardines” (pg. 140).</em> At the refugee camp, Nhan volunteered at the clinic,
          learned
          English, and eventually received U.S. acceptance: <em>“After the people from the UN High Co>mmissioner for
            refugees
            interviewed us, the American consulate interviewed and accepted us. It had been four months since we came to
            the
            camp. Our acceptance was very fast compared with that of many other refugees who had been there before us. I
            was happy
            and excited that we would be settling in America. I didn’t have to worry
            anymore. My husband and I just waited.” (pg. 141).</em></p>
        <p>Soon they arrived at a higher quality camp in Bataan in the Philippines. They felt grateful for the new
          opportunities of education and higher quality amenities at their last stop before America. For Nhan,
          <em>"Bataan was the most memorable place for me
            because it was the place I told my husband that I was pregnant with our first child. That happiness came at
            the
            same time that we heard our names called to go to Manila for our departure to the United States.” (pg.
            141)</em>, they arrived in
          Manchester, New Hampshire in September 1988. "We settled in our new place. It was a shabby apartment, but for
          us it meant more because we had each other and we were safe from our war-torn country. My country would be
          forever in my heart whether I ever had a chance to return.” (pg. 141).</em>
        </p>
        <p>Nhan and her husband took steps to integrate—applying for jobs, medical checkups, and English classes. Her
          early American jobs left her disillusioned: <em>“I was disappointed because I worked very hard. I learned the
            first lesson in America: no company wanted to care for their workers. It's just a job.”
            (pg. 142)</em>. Still, she persisted, eventually giving birth to Sarah in May 1989,
          and later working as a board tester. <em>“I wanted to go to school, but since I had to make a living... I
            didn’t
            have much time to spare for any classes” (pg. 142).</em></p>
        <p>In 1992, the family bought a home in a quiet neighborhood. But despite achieving some stability, Nhan
          struggled with life in America. <em>“I liked living in Vietnam better than America... Life in America is too
            stressful and isolated” (pg. 143).</em> She worked two jobs to support her family and longed for the
          familial
          closeness of her home country.</p>

        <p>In May 1993, she took Sarah and returned to Vietnam for the first time in 7 years. As she arrived from her
          flight, she felt
          anxious for what she would see. It was here she experienced her first taste of the current
          realities of corruption and change: <em>“When I went through immigration and customs, I had to place $5 or $10
            bills in my papers at every checkpoint since other Vietnamese passengers had warned me on the
            airplane:'Bribe
            them. Otherwise they give you a lot of hassle.' It was hot and humid, and I perspired. I wondered if the
            weather or nervousness made me sweat. ” (pg. 143).</em> Reuniting with her family was emotional:
          <em>“We arrived home
            at 8:00 p.m... We all cried. Their hair had already turned shades of salt and pepper. When I had left home,
            their hair was still black and my parents looked vibrant, but now they were thinner and their faces were all
            wrinkled like ocean ripples. I felt a warmness, and I kissed them again and again... There was no language.
            We
            said it all in our hearts.” (pg. 144).</em>
        </p>
        <p>Nhan observed how some parts of the Vietnam she knew had deteriorated: buildings were shabby and malnourished
          children begged in the streets. The way the people also put her on a pedestal made her reflect: <em>“I wasn’t
            rich
            in America. I was a coolie just like anybody else. I wasn't a successful businessperson. How many
            successful Vietnamese are there in America?” (pg. 146).</em> </p>
        <p>During her visit she also encountered an old friend whose appearance had changed in the last 7 years since
          she left: <em>“Her body shivered And I felt like I was embracing a skeleton. It had only been seven years
            since I
            had seen her, and she had changed this much, I thought. She was in her 30s, but she looked like an old
            woman.
            I almost didn't recognize her. She had lost her front teeth, and her lips sunk into her gums.”
            (pg. 147).</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>Before leaving, she prepared a dinner for her family and reflected on the contrasts between her past and
          present life. Her journey from Vietnam to the U.S. was filled with hardship, resilience, and longing—for home,
          for family, and for peace.
