        <p>Lan Nguyen grew up in post-1975 Saigon, Vietnam. She recalled one of her early childhood
          memories, where she met her father for the first time around the age of seven after he returned from a
          standard commmunist
          reeducation camp-- which he was put in for previously serving the Southern Vietnamese army. A vivid image of
          school life remains with her: <em> “As a child in post-1975 Vietnam, I
            particularly disliked one thing. To enter school every day, you had to wear a red handkerchief that stood
            for
            your loyalty to the Communist government. If you didn’t wear it, you couldn’t go to school. Many of us
            wanted
            to wear the red handkerchief, and we often asked each other, ‘What is this for?’ But we had to wear it” (pg.
            35).</em></p>
        <p>Lan’s family struggled under the communist regime. The opportunity for education was limited, especially for
          a family like hers, where the children were from those who had worked with the South Vietnamese or Americans.
          Corruption was rampant: police
          expected bribes and viewed former South Vietnamese families with suspicion. Her father finally insisted they
          flee the country: staying meant having nothing. Her second sister, Dung, escaped in 1983 after several failed
          attempts, eventually reaching the U.S. via Malaysia. Her eldest sister, Linh, was imprisoned multiple times
          but also escaped to Malaysia and then America.</p>
        <p>Lan and her family group escaped in 1987 when she was about 11 years old. During which, she didn't
          know what was happening or that they were fleeing. Escaping the country
          involved a dangerous journey through Cambodia and into Thailand. They had shifty local guides that bribed
          local police and
          helped
          them into a tiny fishing boat. They had almost no supplies after being misled by the guides. Lan recalls a
          terrifying moment when they were dropped off where her weak mother pleaded for one of the shipsman to help
          carry Lan. Instead of being left ashore, she was dropped into the water: <em>“He dropped me in the water and
            said, ‘Here, this
            is
            good enough.’ But I couldn’t feel the bottom with my feet. Although I thought I was drowning, I didn’t lose
            my
            head. I swirled around and was finally able to grab a branch and pull myself up. I thought I was so lucky. I
            didn’t even tell my mother how scared I was because my brother was crying and hungry. Even now I don’t try
            to
            swim because of that experience.” (pg. 39).</em></p>
        <p>After finally making it to Thailand's jungles, some of the group found help from locals after 2 hours of
          looking. They
          were dropped off at the safe port and given food by the kind locals. Lan recalls a refreshing moment after the
          journey they had just gone through: <em>“When my brother saw food and
            water, he
            drank and ate and ate. An hour later, he vomited because he was too tired and had eaten too much. Everybody
            laughed at him. We were so happy to be rescued.” (pg. 40).</em></p>
        <p>At the temporary Thai refugee camp, her mother traded a gold ring for blankets and cookware. The conditions
          were harsh—there was very little food or protection. Lan’s mother worried constantly about her teenage cousin,
          Huong, as young girls were vulnerable to abuse from the guards. The guards were known to mock, intimidate, and
          exploit the refugees. <em>“Every time I remember that camp, it upsets me because they didn’t treat us like
            humans”
            (pg. 41).</em></p>
        <p>Despite these hardships, the family remained hopeful, understanding that camp life was only temporary. After
          about a month, due to reports of guard misconduct, they were transferred to the permanent camp at Phanat
          Nikhom. There, Lan was unexpectedly reunited with her sister, Duyen, who had escaped a month earlier. Duyen
          was placed in the special minors area supported by American and Australian volunteers, while Lan's family
          lived in a crowded building with poor sanitation.</p>
        <p>Life improved in the permanent camp. They were able to save money from successfully emigrated relatives
          (including her father) in
          the U.S., attend
          Vietnamese general-subject day classes, and prepare for immigration interviews. Lan chose to take an extra
          class for English language learning meant for adults, leading to her being the youngest student in the class
          at 11 years old. Lan's mom had her take precautions by wearingat jeans at all times that
          specifically had her father’s U.S. address written in the pockets. Her
          mother had also sewn gold rings into her and her siblings clothes.
          That way some valuables, they had with them. Her family qualified for early resettlement because they had
          young
          children and her father had connections to someone in the U.S. immigration process.</p>
        <p>Upon learning they were finally heading to America, Lan was filled with hope: “When I found out that I was
          actually going to the United States, I thought:<em> ‘Oh, wow. I’m going to America.’ Everything entered my
            mind.
            Oh, America—no dirt on the streets. I imagined some perfect place where everything is clean and our house is
            nice. Because we had been living around so much dirt, the first thing that entered my mind was a clean place
            with a lot of light and beautiful buildings. I was very glad to leave the camp because people said that
            America was wonderful. I almost imagined a utopia” (pg. 45).</em></p>
        <p>After arriving in Bangkok and reaching the airport, Lan and her family were amazed by what they saw,
          bumping into the strange glass walls and seemingly high-tech escalators they had never encountered.</p>

        <p>Lan eventually became a U.S. citizen during her freshman year at Christian Brothers University in Memphis.
          She wishes to return to Vietnam someday to see her grandmother, who once cared for all her grandchildren and
          remained behind during their escape. She laments, though, how her grandmother now suffers from Alzheimer’s and
          is unaware of the support her family
          sends her from abroad or the grandkids they now have.</p>
        <p>Her mother returned to Vietnam in 1995 but found the country too loud, dirty, and harsh. <em>“I don’t think
            my
            mom wanted to stay in Vietnam after either visit. Everything is so much cleaner here. When she went back to
            Vietnam, everything was dirty, and noisy, and too hot, and people’s attitudes were intimidating. In America,
            people don’t have to be tough and fight the way they do in Vietnam. You just go to work and come home and
            cook. You don’t have to fight” (pg. 46).</em> </p>
        <p> Lan notes her mother no longer feels she could reintegrate
          into
          Vietnamese society. Her father, in contrast, dreams of retiring to the countryside to fish.</p>
